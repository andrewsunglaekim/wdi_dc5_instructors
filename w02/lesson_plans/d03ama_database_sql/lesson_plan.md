ACID
- atomicity
  - states that database modifications must follow an all or nothing rule.
- consistency
  - states that only valid data will be written to the database.
- isoloation
  - requires that multiple transactions occuring at the same time not impact each others execution
- durability
  - ensures that any transaction committed to the database will not be lost through the use of database backups and transaction logs
