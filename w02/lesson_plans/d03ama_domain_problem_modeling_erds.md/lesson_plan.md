## Domain/Problem Modeling and Relational Databases

### Learning Objectives

#### Concepts
- explain what a database is and why you would use one
- explain the difference between a database managment system and a database
- explain how a DBMS, a database and SQL relate to own another
- Describe the basic parts of a schema(using ERD's), entities and attributes
-

#### Mechanics
- Use ERD's for domain/database modeling

#### Opening Framing
Where are we now? We've done some basic ruby programming. We've learned about object oriented programming and learned a whole bunch of methods, But we don't have a way to persist our data. For the morning lesson we'll be doing a whole lot of talking and conceptualizing

### Turn and talk to your neighbor
- communicate with your partner some examples of applications that utilize a database.
- write students examples on whiteboard
  - pick a couple to extrapolate and prod students about attributes and entities

##### what is a relationship?
- A relationship creates a connection between entities that allows us to take an item from our database and retrieve items that are related to it

  - start talking about different relationships between entities
    - one-to-one
      - rarer relationship
      - user and their profile
      - 

    - one-to-many
    - many-to-many
