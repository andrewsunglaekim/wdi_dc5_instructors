# Project 1

## Requirements

We will be presenting projects on Friday. Your project must have:

- validations
- tests
- at least two models
- user stories
- ERDs
- a seeds file
- documentation
  - set up instructions
  - good commit messages

When submitting your final project, please open an issue on the homework repo with a
link to the repository containing your project (this should be a new repository).

While you are allowed to discuss your topic with other classmates, you may not share code
or delegate responsibilities.

## Grading

Yes, there is a rubric weâ€™ll use to evaluate your project. More on this later.
