With your new found knowledge of many-to-many associations, Refactor your code for the codealong we did earlier in class.

Instead of a one to many relationship between instructors and students, code a many-to-many relationship
- Use the one-on-one schedule [here](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi_dc5/blob/master/one_on_one_schedule.md)
  - make a new table one_on_ones in your schema file
  - update seed file to match new schema
  - test your new associations in pry
  - *hint* it should work similarly to the doctors/patients/appointments program show in class
