### Where do we start?

Note:

Get them to think smaller & smaller, until they create a card.

- card
- empty deck
- deck with one card
- one suite (13)
- all 52

---

# Why?

---

## Manager's Perspective

- cost/resources
- scope
- schedule

Note:

Managers are taught to manage these 3.

---

# Good
# Fast
# Cheap

Note:

This is a famous phrase in management circles

---

## Pick any two

# Note

We can build something with great quality, quickly, but it ain't gonna be cheap.

---

# $$ BUDGET $$

Note:

It's really all about the budget

---

## resources

- add/remove humans

---

## scope

- steer
- reduce scope to match date

---

## schedule

- progress
- estimate
- perception
- confidence

Note:

Action: Write on board, for future comparison against developer

Manager wants to see progress.
Get some kind of estimate.
Realizes it's all about perception
Wants to hear your confidence

seque: similarity to developer

## Easy Wins

- Small steps
- Feel *progress*
- Not overwhelmed
- Easy to revert
- Better feeling about what is left (*estimate*)
- Level up!

Note:

Review similarity with Manager:
- overwhelmed? you're not going to sound confident
- actual forward motion ensures perception of motion, unless your communication says different
- perception of safety: even if it's all wrong, it's easy to repair

---

# Confidence

Note:

Progress breeds progress.
Progress feeds Confidence, which feeds Progress.

---

# Happiness

Note: and more importantly... Happiness

---

## Don't just take my word for it...
