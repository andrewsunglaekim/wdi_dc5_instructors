### Temperature converter!
AMAco keeps up with the trends, and we know that 'retro' is the latest fad among today's youth. AMAco needs a CLI based temperature converter!

- Create a ruby program that asks the user for input

- It should convert the input from celsius to fahrenheit and then puts that value.

- ask the user what the starting temperature is(fahrenheit or celsius)

- output should be opposite of starting temperature type

- add Kelvin to the program as well!

- Using loops, start making a personal assistant commandline app that has the temperature converter as an option in its interface

- *BONUS* have your personal assistant app do something besides converting temperature!
