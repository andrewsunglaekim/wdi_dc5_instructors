## MORNING EXERCISE!!!

Write a ruby method that creates a pyramid in the terminal that looks like this:

```
# You're not allowed to just puts it as strings

    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
```

*BONUS* - write a ruby method that takes the amount of rows as an argument and a string as an argument
- the method should create a pyramid with the amount of rows being equivalent to the argument
- the pyramid should be constructed with the string that was passed in for the argument

*BONUS Example*

```
# method call
create_pyramid(3, "b")

# calling this method should create this in the terminal
#   b
#  bbb
# bbbbb
```
