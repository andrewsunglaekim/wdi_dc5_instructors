### Titleizer!

AMAco loved what you did with the temperature converter and they want you to add to the personal assistant commandline app!

- Add to your existing program that contains the temperature converter

- the new function of the app should receive user input

- Through the use of enumerables, titleize the input!
  - If the string `"dogs are so cute and cuddly"` is inputed:
  - You should puts something like this: `"The titleized version of the string you entered is: Dogs Are So Cute And Cuddly"`

- The program should still have the same temperature converter function, and should loop back to the main menu after it has titleized the string.

<b>*BONUS*</b>
- have small words like "a", "are", "the", "is", "and" not be capitalized in the puts.
