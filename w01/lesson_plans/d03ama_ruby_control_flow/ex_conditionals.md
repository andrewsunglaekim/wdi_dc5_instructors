## Practice with Conditionals

- Create a ruby program that asks the user for his or her age.
- If the user puts in an age less than 29 tell them they are young.
- If the user puts an age of 30, tell them that it'll be the best year of their life.
- If the user puts an age over 30, tell them their best years are ahead of them.
