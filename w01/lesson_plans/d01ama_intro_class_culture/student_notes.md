## Learning Objectives

* Get to know our fellow students
* Determine some guiding principles for our class culture
* Identify our big goal for the course
* List the core expectations for instructors and students

  * 12 weeks goes by quickly
* People

## Big Goal

>Create a fammunity of collaborative and self-sufficient life-long learners,
empowered with the foundational knowledge to pursue a career in web development.

## Expectations

We discussed the 4 expectations that we have for everyone in this class
(students and instructors):

* Be present and on time
* Participate (during class, in projects, etc)
* Practice (do your homework, 80% required to complete the homework)
* Support each other



## Difference between cohorts

HW & topics may differ slightly
Student expectations around not being on the same topics

## Web Dev 101

Break students into groups of 4-5 and have them build a mind map of web
development topics.

Have each team share out their results, and as an instructor, build a 'master'
map at the front of the class.

Use the resulting map as a guide to frame the course week by week:

* W1: Fundamentals of Programming
* W2: Writing good programs
* W3: Data Modeling and Persistence
*
* W4: Fundamentals of the Web
* W5: MVC Frameworks
* W6: Collaboration
*
* W7: JavaScript / Second Language
* W8: MV* Frameworks (Backbone)
* W9: MV* Framworks / Project
*
* W10: Exploration
* W11: CS Fundamentals / Job Prep
* W12: Final Project


Frame Week 1 day by day, talk about how we are going over similar material as the
pre-work, but more in depth.
