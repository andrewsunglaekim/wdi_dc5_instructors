# Intro to WDI & Class Culture

## Learning Objectives

* Get to know our fellow students
* Determine some guiding principles for our class culture
* Identify our big goal for the course
* List the core expectations for instructors and students
* Map out the various topics and technologies of web development
* Identify how those technologies fit into the arc of the course

## Introductions / Name Game

Frame: Ask their name first

Instructors and Jon introduce themselves, their background, etc.

Instead of having students say something about themselves to the whole group,
I suggest we do human bingo (see PDF) or another small group name game that
encourages mixing.

After exercise, have everyone intro their name and perhaps what they signed most
commonly for human bingo (or equivalent if we do another game).

## Guiding Principles / Class Culture

Frame to the students the importance of conciously building our classroom culture.
We'll be working with each other for the next 12 weeks, and will hopefully know
each other for life, so what we do now can have a big impact on how things turn out.

Write 4 prompts around the room, and ensure students have enough markers to go
around and write their thoughts (10 minutes) or feelings based on the words.

* Goals
* Time
* People
* Learning

Spend another 10 minutes reviewing / discussing what was written by the students,
with the aim of coming to a consensus on our culture.

## Big Goal

Share with students that we as instructors have a big goal that (hopefully)
aligns with their class culture, and that we'd like everyone to join us in setting
this as our big goal.

>Create a fammunity of collaborative and self-sufficient life-long learners,
empowered with the foundational knowledge to pursue a career in web development.

## Expectations

Share with students, that based on the above, we have certain expectations for
them (really they are necessary for them to succeed):

* Be present and on time
* Participate (during class, in projects, etc)
* Practice (do 80% of your homework)
* Support each other (not just with work)

*Possibly*
Ask students what expectations they have of us as instructors. This could be a
good way to model us being good listeners, but also having authority to manage
their expectations.

## Difference between cohorts

HW & topics may differ slightly
Student expectations around not being on the same topics

## Web Dev 101

Break students into groups of 4-5 and have them build a mind map of web
development topics.

Have each team share out their results, and as an instructor, build a 'master'
map at the front of the class.

Use the resulting map as a guide to frame the course week by week:

* W1: Fundamentals of Programming
* W2: Writing good programs
* W3: Data Modeling and Persistence
* 
* W4: Fundamentals of the Web
* W5: MVC Frameworks
* W6: Collaboration
*
* W7: JavaScript / Second Language
* W8: MV* Frameworks (Backbone)
* W9: MV* Framworks / Project
*
* W10: Exploration
* W11: CS Fundamentals / Job Prep
* W12: Final Project


Frame Week 1 day by day, talk about how we are going over similar material as the
pre-work, but more in depth.
